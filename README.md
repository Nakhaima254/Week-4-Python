# File Read & Write Challenge üñãÔ∏è

This Python program reads a file provided by the user, modifies its contents, and writes the modified text into a new file. It also includes error handling to manage common issues like missing files or permission errors.


## Features
- ‚úÖ Reads a file specified by the user.  
- ‚úÖ Handles errors if the file does not exist or cannot be read.  
- ‚úÖ Converts the file contents to **uppercase** as an example modification.  
- ‚úÖ Writes the modified content into a new file with the prefix `modified_`.  

---

## How It Works
1. The program asks the user to enter the filename (e.g., `example.txt`).  
2. It tries to open and read the file.  
3. The contents are transformed (currently to uppercase).  
4. A new file is created with the modified text (e.g., `modified_example.txt`).  
5. If the file cannot be found, or there are permission issues, the program displays an error message instead of crashing.
